# Abstract
Integrated analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression can reveal specific epigenetic patterns that are important during carcinogenesis. We built an integrated database of DNA methylation and gene expression termed MENT (Methylation and Expression database of Normal and Tumor tissues) to provide researchers information on both DNA methylation and gene expression in diverse cancers. It contains integrated data of DNA methylation, gene expression, correlation of DNA methylation and gene expression in paired samples, and clinicopathological conditions gathered from the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas). A user-friendly interface allows users to search for differential DNA methylation by either ‘gene search’ or ‘dataset search’. The ‘gene search’ returns which conditions are differentially methylated in a gene of interest, while ‘dataset search’ returns which genes are differentially methylated in a condition of interest based on filtering options such as direction, DM (differential methylation value), and p-value. MENT is the first database which provides both DNA methylation and gene expression information in diverse normal and tumor tissues. Its user-friendly interface allows users to easily search and view both DNA methylation and gene expression patterns.
